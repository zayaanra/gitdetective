# gitdetective

### Possible implementations
- Use ```os.Exec(...)``` to execute git commands and find statistics related to repo.
- Write code to find statistics yourself (hard-code)
- Rely on third-party libraries

### Idea
The idea here is to produce a visualization of the statistics for a given git repo. The visualization will be in the terminal for convenience. This is a CLI app.
